# What is GNOME Fa? 

Gnome FA is the Persian (Farsi) community of GNOME. Our mission is to encourage Persian-speaking users to experience and enjoy GNOME, while making it easier to use through translation, support, and local resources. We also invite and help contributors to join us in developing and translating software for GNOME, helping the community grow, and empowering Persian speakers to be part of the global open-source movement.
